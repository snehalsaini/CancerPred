A new frontier of medicine in the twenty first century - Genomic Medicine

## Problem Statement:
In current scenario medicines and treatment are same for a particular disease.
Still a treatment or medicine cure 50% of the patients and rest suffer.
High costs of medicines contribute to decreased access to healthcare.
About 60-90 per cent of healthcare spending by poor people is on prescribed medicines which never benefited them.
Sixty per cent (499-649 million) of the population in India does not have regular access to essential medicines.
Even after a lot of expenditure, 60% of the patients fail to get the benefit for from the treatment or medicines (According to NCBI)

# Our Solution
## Genomic Medicine
DNA sequencing has propelled genomics into mainstream medicine, driving a revolutionary shift toward precision medicine.
Genomics investigates how a person's biological information can be used to improve their clinical care and health outcomes (eg through effective diagnosis and personalised treatment.
Goal of precision or genomic medicine is that instead of a “one size fits all” approach by disease type, medicine will be informed by a genetic understanding of the disease. 
Precision medicine not only involves studying the genome, but also considers factors like where a person lives, what they do, and what their family health history . 
Our goal is to develop targeted prevention or treatment approaches with the power of ai algorithms and interactive analyzation low-cost software to help specific individuals stay healthy or get better instead of relying on approaches that are the same for everyone.

## Proof of Concept
We have tried to prove our idea using three different techniques/concepts:
1.  DNA SEQUENCING CLASSIFIER
2.  DNA CANCER RISK MANAGEMENT
3.  Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection for position on gene, scaffold name, associated disease of phenotype, drug linked to disease, and adverse drug reaction annotation.

## DNA Sequencing Classifier
Reads the DNA sequence data provided by the user and predicts the Gene Class corresponding to that DNA.
Our proof of concept illustrates
